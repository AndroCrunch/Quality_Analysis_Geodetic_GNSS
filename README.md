# Quality Analysis of Geodetic-Grade vs Affordable GNSS Receivers

This project is a practical application of GNSS data processing using Python, with emphasis on RINEX data processing, GNSS observables, noise analysis, and performance comparison of geodetic-grade and low-cost GNSS receivers.

## Scope
- Multi-constellation, multi-frequency GNSS observables
- Code noise via code-minus-carrier combinations
- Carrier-phase noise via geometry-free combinations
- Receiver performance comparison

## Tools
Python • Jupyter Notebook • pandas • numpy • matplotlib • roktools
